# Krei

Simple boilerplate for Javascript projects.

## Starting out

Fork the repo to your own account, or simply clone the repo on your computer,
add your own remote and start working.

## Usage

```sh
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

Browse to http://localhost:8081/ to see the result. It's empty now, but start
working in `src/index.js` to make it less empty. The sky is the limit.
